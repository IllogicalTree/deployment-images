# Deployment Images

Quickly spin up a production ready docker image ready to serve your website.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to serve as a reference when deploying static sites, this could be adapted for any framework.

Currently demo projects exist for the following frameworks:

- Angular (ng new angular-demo)
- Vue (vue create vue-demo)
- React (npx create-react-app react-demo)

If your favourite framework is missing open an issue and we can rectify that, I love exploring new frameworks.

## Usage

Navigate into a example repository and run ```docker-compose up``` to spin up a container, this may take some time the firs time as the project dependencies need installed but will be faster on subsequent builds. Once the project has finished building access your site at http://localhost.
